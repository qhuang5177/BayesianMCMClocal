# 1. 
# In the simulate_data.R file, I removed the bits that are commented out
# Also made the SD of the random effects to be an input


# 2. 
# Made a dataset.R file that creates the dataset to be used for the simulations studies
# It is stored in simulated_dataset.RData
# Please let me know if you change it as the long chain will need re-running


# 3.
# I changed the IG prior for the random effects variance to IG(0.01,0.01)
# It is currently pretty informative
